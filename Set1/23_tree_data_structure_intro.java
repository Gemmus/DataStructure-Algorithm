// Tree:
// A non-linear data structure, where nodes are organized in a hierarchy.
// Utilized: File explorer, Databases, DNS, HTML DOM

// Root node (or parent):
// On the top of the tree, has no in-coming edges, only out-going edges.

// Branch nodes (or parent/child):
// Between root node and leaf nodes, has both in-coming and out-going edges.

// Leaf nodes (or child):
// On the bottom of the tree, have no out-going edges, only in-coming edges.

// Siblings: 
// If they share the same parents.

// Subtree:
// Smaller tree held within a larger tree.

// Size of the tree:
// Number of nodes.

// Depth:
// Number of edges below the root node. (Root node level = 0)

// Height
// Number of edges above furthest leaf node. (Leaf node level = 0)
